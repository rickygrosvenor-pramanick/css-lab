With low motivation and self-discipline, he often finds it difficult to keep up with coursework and rarely sets ambitious academic goals. Despite his low grades, Lucas is not particularly anxious about exams, but his lack of perseverance and academic confidence has made it challenging for him to improve his performance. He tends to prioritize other interests over his studies and is in need of support to help him re-engage academically."
