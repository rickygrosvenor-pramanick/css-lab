  "persona": "Jordan Matthews is a 20-year-old Business Administration major who has struggled to maintain a strong academic record, reflected in a CGPA of 1.41. While Jordan experiences relatively low test anxiety, motivation and self-discipline are areas of challenge, leading to inconsistent study habits and lower grades. Despite these setbacks, Jordan remains somewhat persistent and is aware of the need to improve, but often finds it difficult to translate intentions into sustained effort. Jordan may benefit from academic support and mentoring to build confidence and develop more effective study strategies."
